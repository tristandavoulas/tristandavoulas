# Hello, world!

I'm **Tristan** - an aspiring self-taught web developer, and on this page, you can take a look at the projects that I've been working on. I conceptualize, design, and code everything that I've created so far. Currently, I'm focused on gaining more experience with vanilla JavaScript alongside HTML and CSS. Feel free to take a look around and check out my code! If you've enjoyed any of my projects or have any constructive criticism, [reach out to me!](mailto:tristan@davoulas.com) I'd love to hear from you!
